The Visual Studio 2017 (<a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-2017-version-15-8/">15.8 update</a>) is now available for <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/">download</a>, and you should see the 'new update available' notification in the coming weeks--you can also get the update now by downloading the 'free trial' version of the installer which will let you update your system.

<em>All versions of Visual Studio 2017 are out of their "mainstream" [support lifecycle](https://docs.microsoft.com/lifecycle/products/visual-studio-2017) as of <b>April 2022</b>. Platform toolset v141 from 15.9 support is still available in Visual Studio 2019 and Visual Studio 2022 as optional components.</em>.

The latest VS 2017 Redistribution packages are available (<a href="https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/VC_redist.x86.exe">x86</a>, <a href="https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/VC_redist.x64.exe">x64</a>), as well as the Remote Debugging Tools (<a href="https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/RemoteTools.x86ret.enu.exe">x86</a>, <a href="https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/RemoteTools.amd64ret.enu.exe">x64</a>). For more on the Visual Studio 2017 (15.8) update, see the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releasenotes/vs2017-relnotes">release notes</a>. See <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/stl-features-and-fixes-in-vs-2017-15-8/">this post</a> for details on the changes to the Standard Library.

<h1>Compiler and CRT</h1>

VS 2017 (15.8) includes a new version of the C/C++ complier (19.15.26726). This includes some improvements to the <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/msvc-code-optimizer-improvements-in-visual-studio-2017-versions-15-5-and-15-3/">SSA Optimizer</a>, as well as some additional performance improvements for the linker. This also fixes some codegen bugs including <a href="https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/138255/bad-codegen-on-x64.html">this one</a>.

15.8 update | C++ compiler
--|--
15.8.0 | 19.15.26726
15.8.4 | 19.15.26729

15.8.5 | 19.15.26732

A new C++ debugging feature in VS 2017 (15.8) known as "Just My Code" stepping (JMC). For more details, see <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/announcing-jmc-stepping-in-visual-studio/">this blog post</a>.

There's a newly rewritten C++11/C99-compatible preprocessor in progress you can try out with <code>/experimental:preprocessor</code>. For more details see <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/msvc-preprocessor-progress-towards-conformance/">this blog post</a>.

<strong>Note:</strong> Per <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/visual-c-compiler-version/">this blog post</a>, the ``_MSC_VER`` value is now 1915 instead of 1910, 1911, 1912, 1913, or 1914.

The C/C++ Runtime (14.15.26706) is included in this update. Remember that VS 2015 and VS 2017 share the same runtime redistributable binaries and that VS 2015 Update 3 is binary compatible with VS 2017--code or static library built with one can be linked to the other--, so this is the latest version for both.

<strong>C++/WinRT:</strong> The C++/WinRT headers in the Windows 10 SDK (<a href="https://walbourn.github.io/windows-10-april-2018-update-sdk/">17134</a>) are not fully compatible with the latest implementation of <code>/permissive-</code> in VS 2017 (15.8). You can work around the issue leaving Conformance Mode enabled by adding <code>/Zc:twoPhase-</code> to the <i>Additional Options </i>project setting. This is fixed when using the <a href="https://walbourn.github.io/windows-10-october-2018-update/">Windows 10 SDK (October 2018)</a>.

<strong>Xbox One:</strong> By default <code>/JMC</code> is enabled with VS 2017 (15.8) in <em>Debug</em> configurations which can lead to a link error when using the Xbox One XDK (unresolved symbol ``__CheckForDebuggerJustMyCode``). You can easily resolve this by going to your project settings under C/C++ -> General and setting "Support Just My Code Debugging" to "No", and then rebuild. This will be fixed in a future Xbox One XDK QFE at which time you can re-enable this feature if desired.

<strong>JMC:</strong> If you are shipping static libraries built from C++ code using VS 2017 (15.8), you probably want to turn off JMC anyhow to avoid forcing your customers to use 15.8, which otherwise would be compatible with 15.5, 15.6, and/or 15.7 as well. BTW, if you want the same static library to also work with VS 2015, then you are probably better off producing it with VS 2015 Update 3.

<strong>Static analysis: </strong>As I mentioned with the VS 2017 (15.7 update), the <code>/analyze</code> switch now includes some <a href="https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines">C++ Core Guidelines</a> checker rules per <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/c-code-analysis-improvements-for-visual-studio-2017-15-7-preview-1/">this blog post</a>. With VS 2017 (15.8 update), a fair amount of the 'noise' introduced with this change has been addressed.

<strong>GitHub:</strong> I've updated DirectX Tool Kit (<a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTK/releases">DX11</a> / <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTK12/releases">DX12</a>), <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTex/releases">DirectXTex</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXMesh/releases">DirectXMesh</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/UVAtlas/releases">UVAtlas</a> with changes for VS 2017 (15.8), mostly for <code>/analyze</code> cleanup. There's also a new release of <a href="https://github.com/walbourn/directx-vs-templates/releases">directx-vs-templates</a> with a few minor tweaks.
