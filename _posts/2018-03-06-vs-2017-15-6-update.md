<em>All versions of Visual Studio 2017 are out of their "mainstream" [support lifecycle](https://docs.microsoft.com/lifecycle/products/visual-studio-2017) as of <b>April 2022</b>. Platform toolset v141 from 15.9 support is still available in Visual Studio 2019 and Visual Studio 2022 as optional components.</em>.

The latest VS 2017 Redistribution packages are available (<a href="https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/VC_redist.x86.exe">x86</a>, <a href="https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/VC_redist.x64.exe">x64</a>), as well as the Remote Debugging Tools (<a href="https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/RemoteTools.x86ret.enu.exe">x86</a>, <a href="https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/RemoteTools.amd64ret.enu.exe">x64</a>).

<h1>Compiler and CRT</h1>

VS 2017 (15.6) includes a new version of the C/C++ complier (19.13.26128). See <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/c17-progress-in-vs-2017-15-5-and-15-6/">this blog post</a> for details on the latest C++17 Standard conformance as well as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releasenotes/vs2017-relnotes#visual-c-improvements">MSDN</a>. Notably this includes some compile-time improvements, as well as better linker performance when doing <code>/DEBUG:fastlink</code> and map-file generation.

15.6 update | C++ compiler
--|--
15.6.0 |  19.13.26128
15.6.3 |  19.13.26129
15.6.6 |  19.13.26131
15.6.7 |  19.13.26132

<b>Note:</b> Per <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/visual-c-compiler-version/">this blog post</a>, the ``_MSC_VER`` value is now 1913 instead of 1910, 1911, or 1912.

The C/C++ Runtime (14.13.26020) is included in this update. Remember that VS 2015 and VS 2017 share the same runtime redistributable binaries and that VS 2015 Update 3 is binary compatible with VS 2017--code or static library built with one can be linked to the other--, so this is the latest version for both.
