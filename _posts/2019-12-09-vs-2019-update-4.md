Visual Studio 2019 Update 4 (a.k.a. 16.4) is now available for [download](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). For more information see the [Visual Studio Team blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/tis-the-season-visual-studio-2019/).

<em>Updates older than 16.11 of Visual Studio 2019 are out of their [support lifecycle](https://docs.microsoft.com/lifecycle/products/visual-studio-2019) as of <b>October 2022</b>.</em>

The latest VS 2019 Redistribution packages are available ([x86](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/VC_redist.x86.exe), [x64](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/VC_redist.x64.exe)), as well as the Remote Debugging Tools ([x86](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/RemoteTools.x86ret.enu.exe), [x64](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/RemoteTools.amd64ret.enu.exe)). For more on Visual Studio 2019 Update 4, see the [release notes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes).

This release also includes a new tool: [AddressSanitizer (ASan) for Windows](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/addresssanitizer-asan-for-windows-with-msvc/)

> Note that ASan in 16.4 only supports x86 Release mode. [16.7](https://walbourn.github.io/vs-2019-update-7/) updates this with support for Debug and x64 as well.

<h1>Compiler and CRT</h1>

VS 2019 Update 4 includes a new version of the C/C++ compiler (19.24.28314.0). This includes some [improvements for the C++ inliner](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/c-inliner-improvements-the-zipliner/).

The C/C++ Runtime (14.24.28127) is included in this update. Remember that VS 2015, VS 2017, and VS 2019 share the same runtime redistributable binaries and are [binary compatible](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/porting/binary-compat-2015-2017).

<strong>C++20</strong>: The ``/std:c++latest`` switch enables support for C++20 draft features including [conditionally explicit constructors](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/c20s-conditionally-explicit-constructors/).

<strong>C++ Code Analysis</strong>: VS 2019 (16.4) now includes support for clang-tidy for both the Clang and MSVC toolsets. See [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/code-analysis-with-clang-tidy-in-visual-studio/) for details.

<strong>clang/LLVM</strong>: VS 2019 Update 4 includes [clang 9](https://releases.llvm.org/9.0.0/tools/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.html) for Windows as an optional component.

<strong>DirectXMath</strong>: There is a known issue where the <code>IsNan</code> tests can fail when building with <code>/fp:fast</code> due to new optimizations. This is fixed when using [DirectXMath 3.14](https://walbourn.github.io/directxmath-3.14/) in combination with this update.
