<em>Updates older than 16.11 of Visual Studio 2019 are out of their [support lifecycle](https://docs.microsoft.com/lifecycle/products/visual-studio-2019) as of <b>October 2022</b>.</em>

The latest VS 2019 Redistribution packages are available ([x86](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/VC_redist.x86.exe), [x64](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/VC_redist.x64.exe)), as well as the Remote Debugging Tools ([x86](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/RemoteTools.x86ret.enu.exe), [x64](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/RemoteTools.amd64ret.enu.exe)). For more on Visual Studio 2019 Update 2, see the [release notes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes#16.2.0).

<h1>Compiler and CRT</h1>

VS 2019 Update 2 includes a new version of the C/C++ compiler (19.22.27905.0). This includes additional C++20 draft library features and other bug fixes.

The C/C++ Runtime (14.22.27821) is included in this update. Remember that VS 2015, VS 2017, and VS 2019 share the same runtime redistributable binaries and are [binary compatible](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/porting/binary-compat-2015-2017).

> The VS 2019 C/C++ Runtime DLLs includes ``vcruntime140.dll``, ``vcruntime140_1.dll``, ``msvcp140.dll``, ``msvcp140_1.dll``, ``msvcp140_2.dll``, ``concrt140.dll``, and ``vccorlib140.dll``. VS 2019 16.2 adds ``msvcp140_codecvt_ids.dll``. Use of OpenMP also requires ``vcomp140.dll``.

A number of improvements were made for [code generation](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/msvc-backend-updates-in-visual-studio-2019-version-16-2/), [Standard Library performance](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/improving-the-performance-of-standard-library-functions/), and [link times](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/improved-linker-fundamentals-in-visual-studio-2019/) in this update. There were also a number of optimizations made specifically with [game performance in mind](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/game-performance-improvements-in-visual-studio-2019-version-16-2/).

<strong>Known Issue</strong>: There is a known issue for VS 2019 RTM/Update 1/Update 2 when using my Direct3D Game project templates on [GitHub](https://github.com/walbourn/directx-vs-templates/releases). If you have VS 2017 installed as well, it works. Otherwise you need to edit your ``devenv.exe.config``. See [here](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/572125/visual-studio-2019-doesnt-handle-14000-assembly-re.html) for the details. This issue is fixed in [Update 3](https://walbourn.github.io/vs-2019-update-3/).

<strong>Known Issue</strong>: There is a known issue with DirectXMath where the <code>IsNan</code> tests can fail when building with <code>/fp:fast</code> due to new optimizations. This is fixed when using [DirectXMath 3.14](https://walbourn.github.io/directxmath-3.14/) in combination with [Update 3](https://walbourn.github.io/vs-2019-update-3/).

<strong>clang/LLVM</strong>: VS 2019 Update 2 includes integration support for clang for Windows using [CMake](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/visual-studio-cmake-support-clang-llvm-cmake-3-14-vcpkg-and-performance-improvements/) and [MSBuild](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/clang-llvm-support-for-msbuild-projects/) as an 'individual component'. For VS 2019 Update 2, this is [clang 8](https://releases.llvm.org/8.0.0/tools/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.html).
