The Visual Studio 2017 (<a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-2017-version-15-7-and-version-15-8-preview-1/">15.7 update</a>) is now available for <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/">download</a>, and you should see the 'new update available' notification in the coming weeks--you can also get the update now by downloading the 'free trial' version of the installer which will let you update your system.

<em>All versions of Visual Studio 2017 are out of their "mainstream" [support lifecycle](https://docs.microsoft.com/lifecycle/products/visual-studio-2017) as of <b>April 2022</b>. Platform toolset v141 from 15.9 support is still available in Visual Studio 2019 and Visual Studio 2022 as optional components.</em>.

The latest VS 2017 Redistribution packages are available (<a href="https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/VC_redist.x86.exe">x86</a>, <a href="https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/VC_redist.x64.exe">x64</a>), as well as the Remote Debugging Tools (<a href="https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/RemoteTools.x86ret.enu.exe">x86</a>, <a href="https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/RemoteTools.amd64ret.enu.exe">x64</a>). For more on the Visual Studio 2017 (15.7) update, see the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releasenotes/vs2017-relnotes">release notes</a>.

<h1>Compiler and CRT</h1>

VS 2017 (15.7) includes a new version of the C/C++ complier (19.14.26428). See <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/announcing-msvc-conforms-to-the-c-standard/">this post</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releasenotes/vs2017-relnotes#visual-c-improvements">MSDN</a> for details on the changes to C++ conformance.

15.7 update | C++ compiler
--|--
15.7.0 | 19.14.26428
15.7.2 | 19.14.26429
15.7.3 | 19.14.26430
15.7.4 | 19.14.26431
15.7.5 | 19.14.26433

<strong>Note:</strong> Per <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/visual-c-compiler-version/">this blog post</a>, the ``_MSC_VER`` value is now 1914 instead of 1910, 1911, 1912, or 1913.

The C/C++ Runtime (14.14.26405) is included in this update. Remember that VS 2015 and VS 2017 share the same runtime redistributable binaries and that VS 2015 Update 3 is binary compatible with VS 2017--code or static library built with one can be linked to the other--, so this is the latest version for both.

> The VS 2017 C/C++ Runtime DLLs includes ``vcruntime140.dll``, ``msvcp140.dll``, ``msvcp140_1.dll``, ``concrt140.dll``, and ``vccorlib140.dll``. VS 2017 15.7 adds ``msvcp140_2.dll``. Use of OpenMP also requires ``vcomp140.dll``.

<strong>Windows 10 SDK:</strong> When installing a fresh copy of VS 2017 (15.7) the default Windows 10 SDK is now the April 2018 Update (<a href="https://walbourn.github.io/windows-10-april-2018-update-sdk/">17134</a>). Also note that the Windows 10 SDK (17134) is once again one VS install component (<code>Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.Windows10SDK.17134</code>) instead of multiple components (``Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.Windows10SDK.*.Desktop``, ``Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.Windows10SDK.*.UWP``, ``Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.Windows10SDK.*.UWP.Native``) as it was for 15063 / 16299.

<strong>C++/WinRT:</strong> With the Windows 10 SDK (17134), you no longer need to use the GitHub project or NuGet package to obtain the C++/WinRT projection headers as they are now a <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/cppwinrt-is-now-included-the-windows-sdk/">part of the Windows 10 SDK</a>.

<strong>Static Analysis:</strong> The 15.7 update version of <code>/analyze</code> now includes part of the C++ Core Guidelines checkers in the default native ruleset. For more details, see <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/c-code-analysis-improvements-for-visual-studio-2017-15-7-preview-1/">this blog post</a>. The current state of the new <code>/analyze</code> is quite a bit noiser than it was before, so I expect some further refinement in future releases. If you have ``<CodeAnalysisRuleSet>AllRules.ruleset</CodeAnalysisRuleSet>`` in your project files, you'll want to change it since that now pulls in all the <a href="https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines">C++ Core Guidelines</a> Checker rules which is highly likely to be an overwhelming mass of new warnings.

<strong>``__cpluplus``:</strong> The preprocessor symbol ``__cplusplus`` is often used in guards like ``#ifdef __cplusplus`` to handle both C and C++ scenarios, but it also has a value that is supposed to indicate which C++ Standard the compiler conforms to. For various reasons, the Visual C++ compiler has been returning "199711" for ages. The 15.7 update includes a new compatibility switch ``/Zc:__cplusplus`` which will cause the Visual C++ compiler to report the proper value of "201402" (or "201703" if using <code>/std:c++17</code>). It is off by default because it has the potential to break a lot of code. Developers are strongly encouraged to turn on this switch and clean up their codebases for a future where this is on by default. See <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/msvc-now-correctly-reports-__cplusplus/">this blog post</a> for more information.

<strong>Spectre mitigations:</strong> This update includes some changes to the Spectre mitigation compiler support. See <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/spectre-diagnostic-in-visual-studio-2017-version-15-7-preview-4/">this blog post</a> for details.

<strong>GitHub:</strong> I've updated <a href="https://github.com/walbourn/directx-vs-templates/releases">directx-vs-templates</a>, DirectX Tool Kit (<a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTK/releases">DX11</a> / <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTK12/releases">DX12</a>), <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTex/releases">DirectXTex</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXMesh/releases">DirectXMesh</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/UVAtlas/releases">UVAtlas</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/DXUT/releases">DXUT</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/FX11/releases">FX11</a> for VS 2017 (15.7) support. Direct3D 12 developers should also pick up the latest version of <code>D3DX12.H</code> from <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/DirectX-Headers/blob/main/include/directx/d3dx12.h">DirectX-Graphics-Samples</a>
