Visual Studio 2019 RTM (a.k.a. 16.0) is now available for [download](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/), including the updated Community edition. The VS 2019 RTM Redistribution packages are also available ([x86](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/VC_redist.x86.exe), [x64](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/VC_redist.x64.exe)), as well as the Remote Debugging Tools ([x86](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/RemoteTools.x86ret.enu.exe), [x64](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/RemoteTools.amd64ret.enu.exe)). For more information see the [Visual Studio Team blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-2019-code-faster-work-smarter-create-the-future/).

<em>Updates older than 16.11 of Visual Studio 2019 are out of their [support lifecycle](https://docs.microsoft.com/lifecycle/products/visual-studio-2019) as of <b>October 2022</b>.</em>

**Windows SDK:** VS 2019 RTM defaults to installing the Windows 10 October 2018 Update SDK ([17763](https://walbourn.github.io/windows-10-october-2018-update/)). Older Windows SDKs can be selected as optional components.

**IDE:** See [this post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/c-productivity-improvements-in-visual-studio-2019-preview-2/) for some minor IDE productivity improvements.

**New Project Dialog:** Note that the start-up and 'new project dialog' experience has changed significantly for VS 2019. See [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/new-start-window-and-new-project-dialog-experience-in-visual-studio-2019/).

<h1>Compiler and CRT</h1>

VS 2019 includes a new version of the C/C++ compiler (19.20.27508). The toolset has some important [performance, compilation time](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/game-performance-and-compilation-time-improvements-in-visual-studio-2019/) and [link time](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/linker-throughput-improvement-in-visual-studio-2019/) improvements specifically driven by games scenarios. Here is a [list of optimizations](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/msvc-backend-updates-in-visual-studio-2019-preview-2/) from earlier VS 2019 previews. For updates on the C++17/C++20 conformance, see [this post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/cpp17-20-features-and-fixes-in-vs-2019/).

The C/C++ Runtime (14.20.25708) is binary compatible with VS 2015 Update 3 and VS 2017, which means you can safely link code built with VS 2015 Update 3 or VS 2017 with VS 2019. See [this post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/cpp-binary-compatibility-and-pain-free-upgrades-to-visual-studio-2019/) for details.

> The VS 2017 C/C++ Runtime DLLs included ``vcruntime140.dll``, ``msvcp140.dll``, ``msvcp140_1.dll``, ``msvcp140_2.dll``, ``concrt140.dll``, and ``vccorlib140.dll``. VS 2019 adds ``vcruntime140_1.dll``. Use of OpenMP also requires ``vcomp140.dll``.

VS 2019 can target Windows 10, <a href="https://walbourn.github.io/windows-8-1-update/">Windows 8.1</a>, <a href="https://walbourn.github.io/windows-7-service-pack-1/">Windows 7 Service Pack 1</a>, and Windows Vista Service Pack 2. Note that the Visual C++ 2019 REDIST does <strong>not</strong> support Windows 8.0, Windows 7 RTM, Windows Vista RTM, Windows Vista Service Pack 1, Windows XP RTM, Windows XP Service Pack 1, or Windows XP Service Pack 2 as these platforms are all outside their <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/lifecycle">support lifecycle</a>. See [Visual Studio 2019 Product Family System Requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/system-requirements)

<strong>OpenMP:</strong> See [this post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/simd-extension-to-c-openmp-in-visual-studio/) for details on OpenMP 4 SIMD experimental support in VS 2019.

<strong>C++20</strong> The ``/std:c++latest`` switch enables support for C++20 draft features including partial support for ``operator <=>`` (i.e. "spaceship" operator). Experimental support for [modules](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/better-template-support-and-error-detection-in-c-modules-with-msvc-2017-version-15-9/) is also available.

> Note that ``/std:c++latest``  is now incompatible with ``/clr`` and ``/ZW`` (C++/CX).

<strong>C++ Code Analysis</strong>: See [this post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/new-code-analysis-checks-in-visual-studio-2019-use-after-move-and-coroutine/) and [this one](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/concurrency-code-analysis-in-visual-studio-2019/) for news on the latest C++ code analysis (``/analyze``) work. There is also an [in-editor analysis experimental](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/in-editor-code-analysis-in-visual-studio-2019-preview-2/) feature you can try, and some additional [C++ Core Checker](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/lifetime-profile-update-in-visual-studio-2019-preview-2/) features.

<strong>Windows XP:</strong> There is [no support](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/porting/features-deprecated-in-visual-studio?view=vs-2019) for building for Windows XP using the latest toolset. The *C++ Windows XP Support for VS 2017 (v141) tools* are available as an individual optional component in the VS 2019 installer. When building using the ``v141_xp`` Platform Toolset for Windows XP Service Pack 3 target support, remember this uses the Windows 7.1A SDK. The older SDK will generate some warnings in system headers with the new toolset that have to be externally suppressed. See <a href="https://walbourn.github.io/visual-studio-2012-update-1/">VS 2012 Update 1</a> for some additional implications for DirectX development.

<strong>Xbox One XDK:</strong> The Xbox One XDK does not support the VS 2019 toolset. Microsoft GDK supports VS 2017 and VS 2019.

<strong>GitHub:</strong> The <a href="https://walbourn.github.io/direct3d-game-visual-studio-templates-redux/">Direct3D Game templates</a> have been updated to support VS 2019, and the <a href="https://github.com/walbourn/directx-vs-templates/raw/main/VSIX/Direct3DUWPGame.vsix">Direct3DUWPGame.vsix</a> now supports VS 2015, VS 2017, and VS 2019. I've also added VS 2019 projects to _DirectX Tool Kit_ for [DX11](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTK/releases) / [DX12](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTK12/releases), [DirectXTex](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTex/releases), [DirectXMesh](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXMesh/releases), [UVAtlas](https://github.com/Microsoft/UVAtlas/releases), [DXUT](https://github.com/Microsoft/DXUT/releases), and [Effects11](https://github.com/Microsoft/FX11/releases) in the April 2019 releases.

<strong>Known Issue</strong>: There is a known issue for VS 2019 RTM/Update 1/Update 2 when using my Direct3D Game project templates on [GitHub](https://github.com/walbourn/directx-vs-templates/releases). If you have VS 2017 installed as well, it works. Otherwise you need to edit your ``devenv.exe.config``. See [here](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/572125/visual-studio-2019-doesnt-handle-14000-assembly-re.html) for the details. This issue is fixed in [Update 3](https://walbourn.github.io/vs-2019-update-3/).

<strong>Known Issue</strong>: There is a known issue with DirectXMath where the <code>IsNan</code> tests can fail when building with <code>/fp:fast</code> due to new optimizations. This is fixed when using [DirectXMath 3.14](https://walbourn.github.io/directxmath-3.14/) in combination with [Update 3](https://walbourn.github.io/vs-2019-update-3/).
